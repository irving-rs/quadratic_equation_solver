# quadratic_equation_solver
Quadratic Equation Solver: A simple program that solves the famous equation.

Programmed in Python 3.8.5, uses CLI. 
You can always rely on it to solve equations when you couldn't. XD
## Basics:
- The user must indicate the coefficient values.
- The quadratic equation has the form: a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0
- Computes real roots, complex roots, one root case including roots equal to zero.

## Run:
- Real roots:
